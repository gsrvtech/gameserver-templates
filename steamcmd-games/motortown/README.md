## PLEASE NOTE !!!!!

You **MUST** disable SteamGuard completely (also no email auth), because steamcmd does not push the requests to the mobile phone and email code cannot be entered in the Ptero Install console.

As soon as DepotDownloader supports private repos or the server is hosted in public, I will use DepotDownloader.

## Proton or Wine?
The repo contains a Proton and a Wine Egg.

**You should use the Proton egg**. However, there are systems on which Proton does not run. These should then use the Wine Egg

## Server Ports

The MotorTown server requires two ports. One as Gameport; one as QueryPort. You can use every port you want.

| Port | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game | USE, what you want |
| Query | USE, what you want |
